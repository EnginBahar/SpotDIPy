# SpotDIPy
An easy way for stellar Doppler imaging of cool single stars.

SpotDIPy has released a new version that generates surface brightness maps for single cool stars by simultaneously modeling both spectral and light curve data using a three-temperature approximation. Detailed information about the installation and usage of the code will be shared soon.
